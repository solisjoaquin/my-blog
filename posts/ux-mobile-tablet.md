There are some clear distinctions between the two device types. We need to consider these when we design user experiences.

### The Smartphone

Smartphones are:

- More mobile than tablets and more likely to be used in a wide variety of locations and scenarios.
- More likely to suffer from distracted use.
- Smaller screen size than tablets.
- Rarely the primary access point for users to the internet (though in developing nations they may be).
- Likely to be used for multi-tasking (users flit from app to app rather than spending significant periods of time doing any particular task).
- More personal and thus more likely to be used for social and emotional contexts.
- Less likely to have controlled lighting available when in use.

### The Tablet

Tablets are:

- Less mobile; they’re too big to be user-friendly in all spaces (though we’ve noticed this doesn’t stop people from trying, nonetheless).
- More likely to be used in a fixed position (at home, in the office, in a café).
- More likely to be shared among family or partners, especially children.
- More likely to provide higher resolution (or at least bigger) experiences than a smartphone.
- More likely to invite the “free browsing” of content versus the more focused experience of scrolling through images and text on mobile

Both tablets and smartphones require “fat finger friendly” designs. 44-pixel targets are a recommended minimum for buttons, icons, etc.
