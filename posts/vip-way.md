The mobile UX design is defined in three ways: Visual, Interruptible and Playful. You can keep these parameters in mind while you design and evaluate your mobile experiences.

- **Visual**: Do the layouts work, are the controls (such as buttons and form fields) visible, do each of the elements have sufficient contrast?

- **Interruptible**: Can the user pick up a task or navigate easily after an interruption? Are related elements spaced properly so that users don’t accidentally commit errors?

- **Playful**: Does the interface consider the user’s emotional or social context?
