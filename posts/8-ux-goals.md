## 1. Make it Easy to Use

First and foremost, your app or mobile experience needs to be easy to use. Because we are constrained by the screen size, it’s essential that our design is as clear and straightforward as possible.

## 2. Make it Easy to Learn

We want our mobile experience to be easy to use, but we also want it to be easy to learn. If your user hasn’t used your app in a while, you want them to be able to remember how to navigate through the experience.

## 3. Make it Easy to Comprehend

Comprehension has a lot to do with UX writing, the written content in your mobile experience. Badges, notifications, labels and any microcopy need to be understandable and unambiguous—you want users to understand what you meant to say.

## 4. Make it Sociable

We’re social creatures and our mobile devices reflect that. We want our users to be able to interact with others, form connections and strengthen relationships. Moreover, we want the social aspects of our design to align with our user’s goals.

## 5. Make it Emotionally Compelling

A factor to determine the success of your mobile experience is whether your user is able to make a meaningful connection with your app.

## 6. Make it Respect our User’s Attention

In a world of shorter attention spans and countless distractions, it’s important to keep our users focused. We want to prevent unnecessary interruptions. We do this with the way we design our notifications.

## 7. Make it Accessible

Accessibility is a fundamental part of UX design, not just a box to tick or a guideline to follow. You have to make your mobile experience, or any experience for that matter, accessible. Accessible products are an ethical responsibility, and allow your product to reach as many people as possible, regardless of their ability.

## 8. Make it Inclusive

Accessibility and inclusivity are in many ways connected. Inclusiveness in UX design is not just about making your experience accessible for everyone; it’s about making your users feel welcome, respected, represented and included.
